    "## 1. Introduction to Microservices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microservices** is an architectural style where applications are built as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services that communicate over a network. Each service handles a specific business functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Responsibility**: Each service does one thing well\n",
    "- **Loose Coupling**: Services are independent; changes don't cascade\n",
    "- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together\n",
    "- **Decentralised Data Management**: Each service owns its data\n",
    "- **Design for Failure**: Assume services will fail; build resilience\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent deployment and scaling\n",
    "- Technology flexibility (use best tool for each service)\n",
    "- Faster development cycles\n",
    "- Fault isolation\n",
    "- Easier to understand individual services\n",
    "- Better team autonomy"

    "| Structure | Single deployable unit | Multiple independent services |\n",
    "| Scaling | Scale entire application | Scale individual services |\n",
    "| Development | Single codebase, one team | Multiple codebases, distributed teams |\n",
    "| Deployment | Deploy everything together | Deploy services independently |\n",
    "| Technology | One technology stack | Polyglot (different languages/frameworks) |\n",

    "- Large teams working on different features\n",
    "- Need to scale components independently\n",
    "- Different parts have different resource requirements\n",
    "- Want technology flexibility\n",
    "\n",

    "- Small team or early-stage project\n",
    "- Simple domain with few features\n",
    "- Don't have DevOps expertise\n",

    "## 3. Common Microservices Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 API Gateway Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "An **API Gateway** acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to appropriate microservices, handles authentication, rate limiting, and can aggregate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Client -> [API Gateway] -> Service A\n",
    "                       -> Service B\n",
    "                       -> Service C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Single entry point for clients\n",
    "- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, rate limiting) in one place\n",
    "- Protocol translation\n",
    "- Response aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Service Discovery Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In dynamic environments, services need to find each other. **Service discovery** maintains a registry of available services and their locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types:**\n",
    "- **Client-side discovery**: Client queries registry, chooses instance (e.g., Netflix Eureka)\n",
    "- **Server-side discovery**: Load balancer queries registry (e.g., AWS ALB)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Service A -> [Service Registry] -> Gets Service B location -> Service B\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Circuit Breaker Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Circuit Breaker** prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service. It operates in three states:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Closed**: Normal operation; requests flow through; failures are counted\n",
    "2. **Open**: Threshold exceeded; requests fail immediately (fast-fail)\n",
    "3. **Half-Open**: After timeout, allows test requests to check if service recovered"

    "### 8.1 RESTful Endpoint Naming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "1. Use **nouns**, not verbs (HTTP method provides the verb)\n",
    "2. Use **plural** nouns for collections\n",
    "3. Use **lowercase** with hyphens for multi-word\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical** structure for relationships\n",
    "5. **Avoid** file extensions in URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good\n",
    "GET  /users                 # List users\n",
    "GET  /users/123             # Get user 123\n",
    "GET  /users/123/orders      # User's orders\n",
    "POST /users                 # Create user\n",
    "PUT  /users/123             # Update user\n",
    "DELETE /users/123           # Delete user\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bad\n",
    "GET  /getUsers              # Verb in URL\n",
    "GET  /user                  # Singular\n",
    "GET  /users/123/getOrders   # Verb in URL\n",
    "POST /createUser            # Verb in URL\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microservices:**\n",
    "- Small, independent services with single responsibility\n",
    "- Key patterns: API Gateway, Service Discovery, Circuit Breaker\n",
    "- Trade-off: Flexibility vs infrastructure complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docker Compose:**\n",
    "- Multi-container orchestration via YAML\n",
    "- Services communicate via service names as hostnames\n",
    "- Use volumes for persistence, networks for isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST APIs:**\n",
    "- Stateless, resource-oriented architecture\n",
    "- HTTP methods: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove)\n",
    "- Status codes: 2xx success, 4xx client error, 5xx server error\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Design:**\n",
    "- Use nouns, plural, lowercase, hierarchical URIs\n",
    "- Version via URI path (`/v1/`)\n",
    "- Include error codes, messages, and request IDs\n",
    "- Use cursor-based pagination for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Frameworks:**\n",
    "- Flask: Simple, synchronous, explicit\n",
    "- FastAPI: Modern, async, automatic validation and docs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interview Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Know the trade-offs**: Microservices vs monolith, JWT vs OAuth, offset vs cursor pagination\n",
    "2. **Explain patterns**: Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures; API Gateway centralises cross-cutting concerns\n",
    "3. **Design clean APIs**: Resource-oriented, proper status codes, consistent error responses\n",
    "4. **Understand Docker networking**: Service names as hostnames, custom networks for isolation\n",
    "5. **Compare frameworks**: Know when FastAPI's async and auto-validation are worth the trade-offs"
